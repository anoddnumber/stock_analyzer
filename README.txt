This project will do several things.

1) Download historical and current stock data
2) Download historical and current financial documents' data (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cashflow Statement)
3) Have utilities to calculate intrinsic value of a stock and other indicators
4) Have a UI to display the data
5) Have a way to sort and filter the data by certain characteristics
6) Have a way to simulate buying and selling securities from the past with fake money

Some things to think about:
- How should we store the stock data?
- We will want APIs to sort and filter the data, so we should store the data in a way that is easy to do so.
