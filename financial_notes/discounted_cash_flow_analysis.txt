Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp


Uses future cash flows to try to estimate the current intrinsic value of the company (which is called the present value).
Future cash flows are discounted to the current value using a given discount rate. Warren Buffett uses the long term treasury
bonds' interest rate as the discount rate.

DCF heavily relies on accurate predictions of future cash flow in order to be accurate.
