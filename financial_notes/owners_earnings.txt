Owner's Earnings

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owner_earnings#:~:text=Owner%20earnings%20is%20a%20valuation,minus%20any%20reinvestment%20of%20earnings.

Valuation method used by Warren Buffett.

"The value of a company is simply the total of the net cash flows (owner's earnings) expected to occur over the life of the business, minus any reinvestment of earnings"

Owner's Earnings = earnings + depreciation + depletion + amortization + other non-cash charges - average annual capital expenditures for plant and equipment

Warren Buffett says "average annual capital expenditures for plant and equipment" is an estimate that may be tricky to get right.
Wall Street normally ignores "average annual capital expenditures for plant and equipment" but it is an important part to get correct in order to value a company accurately.


Owner's Earnings is a representation of all the cash that the company will have for a particular year.
Add up all the Owner's Earnings (with a discounted value) and you will have all the company's lifetime value.


Explanation of the formula:

-Earnings is the profit the company got in the year/term. It represents cash so therefore should be part of the equation.

-Depreciation is a representation of the decrease in value of a tangible asset. However, it does not actually decrease cash flow
as cash is not taken away from the company, therefore we add it back to the earnings.

-Depletion is similar to depreciation but refers to the decrease in value of a natural resource.

-Amortization is also similar to depreciation but refers to the decrease in value of an intangible asset.

-Other non-cash charges is any expense that isn't covered by depreciation, depletion, and amortization that is also unrelated to cash.

-"Average annual capital expenditures for plant and equipment" refers to any cash used to maintain the business. We need to subtract this from the owner's earnings because it reduces cash.
